It shows in real time how the needdles and the graph changes through each iteration.

The user just needs to type the number of needdles and the number of times you want it to repeat (The number of needles is limited 
by 1000 and the number of executions is limited by 100. For both the graphic and the canvas to be as "clean" as posible.
But maybe i'll change that in the future).

> Maybe in future updates i'll add a table so the user can see both the approximation of pi and the iteration.
